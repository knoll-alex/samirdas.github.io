# Style Guide for Reveal Presentations

Here are some quick tips to use as reference when building/updating LORIS-related presentations in Reveal.js

### Architecture

Using Reveal.js, these presentations are organized into columns and rows. You shouldn't have more than 10 rows per column—even that is pushing it. Organize columns in a logical way that tells "a story" to the reader. While designed to be presented, these are also accessible online by anyone that wants to learn more. Therefore, slides should work together in a way that the context and intnded purpose is always clear. 

### Colours

LORIS orange: #f27c30
CBRAIN blue: #12a3d8

Otherwise, stick to white or black font

### Hyperlinks

Try to link as many images and headings as possible, where applicable. Make sure to use the `target=”_blank”` function to ensure hyperlinks open up in a new browser tab.

### Images

Ensure images are always big enough to see clearly. If images include text, you should be able to read the text.
